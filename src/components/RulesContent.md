- 👥 3-10 Players
- ⏱ 5 Minutes Rounds
- 📱 1 Device per player

#### Setup

- Players must input the same 🎲&nbsp;Game Code, 🔢&nbsp;Round Number, and 👥&nbsp;Total players count
- Players must pick a **unique** 👤&nbsp;Avatar
- When the game starts, **players must confirm that they have the same Fingerprint** (the game is void otherwise)

#### During the game

- All players are in the same location
- The spy has to guess the current location
- The other players have to guess who the spy is
- The first player picks another person and asks them a question about the location (Do people wear a uniform? Is there a specific color in this place? ...)
- The player who just answered the question asks the next question to another person

#### When the timer ends

- Players vote to designate the spy
  - If the players have voted for the spy, the spy has one chance to guess the location and win the game
  - If the players have voted for an innocent, the spy wins

#### At any time

- The players can vote for a spy if they have a majority
- The spy can guess the location. The spy wins the game if he guessed correctly, or loses otherwise
